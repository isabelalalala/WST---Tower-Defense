# Immune Defense

A biological tower defense game played in the bloodstream. Deploy white blood cells along five lanes of arteries to fend off pathogens — but watch out for inflammation!

Built with React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and HTML5 Canvas.

## Quick Start

Requires **Node.js 18+** and **npm** (or pnpm/yarn).

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server (opens http://localhost:5173)
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## How to Play

- **Goal:** Stop pathogens from reaching the left edge of the screen.
- **ATP** is your currency. Place **Stem Cells** to generate ATP drops — click them to collect.
- Click a defender card at the bottom, then click a cell on the grid to place it.
- **Inject** Remove a defender to recover half of its ATP cost.
- **Inflammation:** if you place 3+ defenders in a single lane, that lane becomes inflamed. Pathogens slow down inside it, but Stem Cells in inflamed lanes generate ATP at half speed. Plan your placement.
- Survive all 7 waves to win.

### Defenders

| Cell | Cost | Role |
|------|------|------|
| Stem Cell | 50 | Generates ATP drops |
| Neutrophil | 100 | Shoots antibodies forward |
| Eosinophil | 150 | Devours pathogens up close |
| Basophil | 175 | Releases damaging spore clouds |
| Monocyte | 50 | Squashes the first pathogen in lane (single-use) |
| T Cell | 25 | Buried mine, detonates on contact |
| B Cell | 325 | Fires antibodies in 3 lanes simultaneously |
| Platelets | 125 | Clots the entire lane in fire (single-use) |

### Pathogens

Parasites, Protozoa, Fungi, Prokaryotes, Viruses, and Prions — each with unique HP, speed, and damage.

All game logic lives in `src/game/`. Rendering is pure HTML5 Canvas — no game framework.
